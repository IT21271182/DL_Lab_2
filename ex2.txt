What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
When the number of hidden nodes in the neural network increases, the model gains more capacity to learn complex patterns from the data. This can lead to a lower training error as the model better captures the underlying relationships within the data. However, if the number of hidden nodes becomes too large, the model might overfit the training data, performing well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.

Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
As the number of hidden nodes increases, the accuracy on the training set generally improves because the model can learn more complex representations. However, there is a point where adding more hidden nodes provides diminishing returns and may start to cause overfitting. The pattern typically shows an initial increase in accuracy, followed by a plateau, and potentially a decrease in performance if overfitting occurs. The optimal number of hidden nodes balances learning complexity and generalization to new data.
